# haskell_scheme

Scheme interpreter written in Haskell.

## Description

This is a small project focused on learning Haskell. Instead of going through basic tutorials, the goal of this project is to take the hard approach to learning the language by implementing a scheme. Inspiration of the project is from George Hotz (geohot) through his Twitch livestreams. The main project page can be found [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).
